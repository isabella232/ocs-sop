To Extend the cluster threshold ratio ,  follow the below mentioned steps

*Extend the Ceph cluster full threshold*

Execute the following command to extend the ceph cluster full threshold
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc process -n openshift-storage ocs-extend-cluster | oc create -f -
----

Now the ceph cluster threshold is extended from 0.85 to 0.87, this will make the cluster to get out of HEALTH_ERR state.
Notify the customer once it is out of HEALTH_ERR state to delete some of the existing data. When the customer is done deleting data ,
you need to revert the threshold to the previous value.
 
Before reverting the threshold, the existing job resource should be deleted:
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc delete job ocs-extend-cluster-job -n openshift-project
----

Once the old job is removed, re-run the extend cluster job to revert it to the previous threshold value
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc process -n openshift-storage ocs-extend-cluster | oc create -f -
----
