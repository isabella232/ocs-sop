To Extend the cluster , and reset is back, follow the below mentioned steps

*Extend the ceph cluster by 0.02*

To extend the ceph cluster, you can now just run the following command 

----
oc process -n openshift-storage ocs-extend-cluster | oc create -f -
----

Now the ceph cluster is extended by 0.02, the cluster state would become healthy
Notify the customer once the cluster is healthy. When the customer is done deleting data ,
you need to return the threshold to the previous value.
 
but before you reset your cluster back to the previous threshold value, you should delete the existing job resource:

----
oc delete job ocs-extend-cluster-job -n openshift-project
----

Once you have deleted the old job, you can re-run the extend cluster job again to reset it back to the previous threshold value

----
oc process -n openshift-storage ocs-extend-cluster | oc create -f -
----
